            I have lots of thoughts! As I'm sure you do too!<br/>
            I find that writing them down is useful in several ways.<br/>
            Namely, the activity of writing down your thoughts takes 
            all the thoughts swirling in your head â€“ in all it's mess -  
            and gives it structure / organization.<br/>
            This effect seems to be more pronounced when writing for an audience.<br/>
            It also gives you a fun record to look back at.<br/>
            The logic being you change over time. That change includes your thoughts.<br/>
            Record your thoughts across a lifetime and you get to see how they progressed 
            - in all their twists and turns - throughout your lifetime.<br/>
            <br/>
            So really, what I'm saying is... just being perfectly honest with you, this might 
            be more of an activity for me than for you.ðŸ˜…<br/>
            But hope you get something out of it too! Because unless we lived the exact same lives, <br/>
            I'm pretty sure our different experiences 
            would lead to us having different thoughts that were molded by those experiences.<br/>
            <br/>
            So let's get it started! Shall we?<br/>
            On the right you can pick either the chronological or topical option 
            to start browsing through my head (or what was once in it at least).<br/>
            Just promise me you won't get lost in there OK? ðŸ˜†
